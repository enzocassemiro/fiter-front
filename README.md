# :mag_right: Fiter Front End Test

This Challenge was created with the idea of â€‹â€‹getting to know your skills as a Jr frontend developer. The test is simple and no tricks, so take the opportunity to show techniques and technologies that you think are relevant.

## :pushpin: Problem

You should create an application using ReactJS consuming the data [from this endpoint](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/enzocassemiro/e8a324aff1592ffc296061fdf5f3930f/raw/441a5370da14abbd57ab0c1aafa1de66b3cbab5c/employees.json) **(endpoint changed to test responsiveness)** to **list in fiter card format**. These cards must contain the following information:

- Photo
- Name
- Position
- Cellphone

Remember, Fiter is a growing startup, so **your application must be prepared to list a large number of collaborators** and don't forget to validate the **responsiveness** of the application.
